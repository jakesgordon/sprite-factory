Sprite Factory (v1.5.3)
=======================

The sprite factory is a ruby library that can be used to generate
[CSS sprites](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sprites). It combines
individual image files from a directory into a single unified sprite image
and creates an appropriate CSS stylesheet for use in your web application.

The library provides:

 * both a ruby API and a command line script
 * many customizable options
 * support for multiple layout algorithms - horizontal, vertical or [packed](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/)
 * support for any stylesheet syntax, including [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
 * support for any image library, including [RMagick](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/) and [ChunkyPNG](https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png).
 * support for any css selector style, including :hover pseudo-class selectors
 * support for pngcrush'n the generated image file
 * compatible with Rails 3.1 asset pipeline


Installation
============

    $ gem install sprite-factory

An image library is also required. SpriteFactory comes with built in support for
[RMagick](http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/) or [ChunkyPng](https://github.com/wvanbergen/chunky_png).

RMagick is the most common image libary to use, installation instructions for ubuntu:

    $ sudo aptitude install imageMagick libMagickWand-dev
    $ sudo gem install rmagick

ChunkyPng is lighter weight but only supports .png format:

    $ gem install chunky_png

SpriteFactory can also be easily extended to use the image library of your choice.

Usage
=====

Use the `sf` command line script specifying the location of your images.

    $ sf images/icons

This will combine the individual image files within that directory and generate:

 * images/icons.png
 * images/icons.css

You can also use the SpriteFactory class directly from your own code:

    require 'sprite_factory'

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons')

The original image file name is used for the CSS class to show that image in HTML:

    <img src='s.gif' class='high'>         # e.g. original image was high.png
    <img src='s.gif' class='medium'>       # e.g. original image was medium.png
    <img src='s.gif' class='low'>          # e.g. original image was low.png

If original image files are included in sub-folders, the relative path
name will be used for the CSS class to show that image in HTML:

    <img src='s.gif' class='other_high'>   # e.g. original image was other/high.png
    <img src='s.gif' class='other_medium'> # e.g. original image was other/medium.png
    <img src='s.gif' class='other_low'>    # e.g. original image was other/low.png

When using a framework such as Rails, you would usually DRY this up with a helper method:

    def sprite_tag(name)
      image_tag('s.gif', :class => name)
    end

>> NOTE: `s.gif` is the traditional name of a 1x1 pixel transparent .gif used as a
dummy `src` when the true image comes from a css background attribute. Technically,
for css sprites, you could just use a `div` with a class instead of an `img`, but
to keep the markup semantic it is common to use an `img` tag with a dummy `src=s.gif`.

Customization
=============

Much of the behavior can be customized by overriding the following options: 

 - `:layout`       - specify layout algorithm (horizontal, vertical or packed)
 - `:style`        - specify stylesheet syntax (css, scss or sass)
 - `:library`      - specify image library to use (rmagick or chunkypng)
 - `:selector`     - specify custom css selector (see below)
 - `:cssurl`       - specify custom css url (see below)
 - `:output_image` - specify output location for generated image (default: &lt;input folder&gt;.png)
 - `:output_style` - specify output location for generated stylesheet (default: &lt;input folder&gt;.&lt;style&gt;)
 - `:pngcrush`     - pngcrush the generated output image (if pngcrush is available)
 - `:padding`      - add padding to each sprite
 - `:margin`       - add margin to each sprite
 - `:width`        - fix width of each sprite to a specific size
 - `:height`       - fix height of each sprite to a specific size
 - `:nocss`        - suppress generation of output stylesheet (`run!` returns css content as a string instead)
 - `:nocomments`   - suppress generation of comments in output stylesheet

Options can be passed as command line arguments to the `sf` script:

    $ sf images/icons --style sass --layout packed

Options can also be passed as the 2nd argument to the `#run!` method:

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons', :style => :sass, :layout => :packed)

You can see the results of many of these options by viewing the sample page that
comes with the gem in `test/images/reference/index.html`.

>> NOTE: only the common options are available via the command line script (to keep it simple). Specifically,
the advanced `width`, `height`, and `nocss` options are only available via the Ruby interface.

>> NOTE: the `width`, `height` and `padding` options are not particularly useful - you would be better off just
making your source images have the correct dimensions by editing them appropriately in photoshop (or your editor of choice)

>> NOTE: the `margin` option is used primarily to buffer each image in the generated sprite with > 1px margin to
avoid images bleeding into each other when the browser needs to scale them (e.g. when user increases/decreases font size).

Layout
======

The generated image can be laid out in a horizontal or a vertical strip by
providing a `:layout` option (defaults to horizontal). A **new option in v1.2.0** is
to use a  **:packed** layout which will attempt to generate an optimized packed
square-ish layout.

Customizing the CSS Selector
============================

By default, the CSS generated is fairly simple. It assumes you will be using `<img>`
elements for your sprites, and that the basename of each individual file is suitable for
use as a CSS classname. For example, the following files:

    images/icons/high.png
    images/icons/medium.png
    images/icons/low.png

... when run with:

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons')

... will generate the following css:

    img.high   { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png)   0px 0px no-repeat; }
    img.medium { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png) -16px 0px no-repeat; }
    img.low    { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png) -32px 0px no-repeat; }

If you want to use different selectors for your rules, you can provide the `:selector` option. For
example:

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons', :selector => 'span.icon_')

... will generate:

    span.icon_high   { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png)   0px 0px no-repeat; }
    span.icon_medium { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png) -16px 0px no-repeat; }
    span.icon_low    { width: 16px; height: 16px; background: url(images/icons.png) -32px 0px no-repeat; }

Customizing the CSS Selector Per Image
======================================

If you want to specify a custom selector for each individual image, then name the image files
accordingly - the library will map '\_\_' (double underscore) to a single space ' ' in any source
image filename. For example:

    images/icons/div.foo__span.icon_alert.png
    images/icons/div.bar__span.icon_alert.png

... when run with:

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons', :selector => 'div.example ')

... will generate:

    div.example div.foo span.icon_alert { ... first file   ... }
    div.example div.bar span.icon_alert { ... second file  ... }
    

If you want to specify a psuedo class such as `:hover` for some of your images, the library will also
map '--' (double dash) to a colon ':' in any source image filename. For example:

    images/icons/alert.png
    images/icons/alert--hover.png

... when run with:

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/icons', :selector => 'span.icon_')

... will generate:

    span.icon_alert       { ... first file  ... }
    span.icon_alert:hover { ... second file ... }

Customizing the CSS Image Url
=============================

Within the generated CSS file, it can be tricky to get the correct path to your unified
sprite image. For example, you might be hosting your images on Amazon S3, or if you are
building a Ruby on Rails application you might need to generate URL's using the `#image_path`
helper method to ensure it gets the appropriate cache-busting query parameter.

By default, the SpriteFactory generates simple url's that contain the basename of the
unified sprite image, e.g:

    SpriteFactory.run('icons')

    # generates: url(icons.png)

...but you can control the generation of these url's using the `:cssurl` option:

For most CDN's, you can prepend a simple string to the image name:

    SpriteFactory.run('icons',
                      :cssurl => "http://s3.amazonaws.com/")

    # generates:  url(http://s3.amazonaws.com/icons.png)

For more control, a simple token replacement can be performed using the $IMAGE token. For example, to generate calls
to custom Sass helper functions, such as those provided by [sass-rails](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails) plugin:

    SpriteFactory.run('icons',
                      :cssurl => "image-url('$IMAGE')")

    # generates:  image-url('icons.png')


For full control, you can provide a lambda function and generate your own values:

    SpriteFactory.run('icons',
                       :cssurl => lambda{|image| "url(#{image_path(image)})" })

    # generates:   url(/path/to/my/images/icons.png?v123456)

>> NOTE: the `:cssurl` option replaces `:csspath` from earlier versions. The previous option only let you
customize the path inside of the generated `url(...)`, while this new option allows you to customize the
entire value, including the outer `url(...)` itself.

Customizing the entire CSS output 
=================================

If you want **complete** control over the generated styles, you can pass a block to the `run!` method.

The block will be provided with information about each image, including the generated css attributes. 
Whatever content the block returns will be inserted into the generated css file.

    SpriteFactory.run!('images/timer') do |images|
      rules = []
      rules << "div.running img.button { cursor: pointer; #{images[:running][:style]} }"
      rules << "div.stopped img.button { cursor: pointer; #{images[:stopped][:style]} }"
      rules.join("\n")
    end

The `images` argument is a hash, where each key is the basename of an image file, and the
value is a hash of image metadata that includes the following:

 * `:style`  - the default generated style
 * `:cssx`   - the css sprite x position
 * `:cssy`   - the css sprite y position
 * `:cssw`   - the css sprite width
 * `:cssh`   - the css sprite height
 * `:x`      - the image x position
 * `:y`      - the image y position
 * `:width`  - the image width
 * `:height` - the image height

>> NOTE: the image coords can differ form the css sprite coords when padding/margin or fixed width/height options are specified)

Using sprite-factory with the Rails asset pipeline
==================================================

The sprite-factory gem plays nice with the Rails asset pipeline with a few simple steps:

Add the sprite-factory to your Gemfile, including your chosen image library dependency:

    group :assets do
      gem 'sprite-factory', '>= 1.5.2'
      gem 'rmagick'
    end

Store your images in Rails 3.1 `app/assets/images` sub-folders, e.g

    app/assets/images/avatars/*.png
    app/assets/images/icons/*.png
    ...

Create a Rake task for regenerating your sprites, e.g. in `lib/tasks/assets.rake`

    require 'sprite_factory'

    namespace :assets do
      desc 'recreate sprite images and css'
      task :resprite => :environment do 
        SpriteFactory.cssurl = "image-url('$IMAGE')"    # use a sass-rails helper method to be evaluated by the rails asset pipeline
        SpriteFactory.run!('app/assets/images/avatars', :output_style => 'app/assets/stylesheets/avatars.css.erb')
        SpriteFactory.run!('app/assets/images/icons',   :output_style => 'app/assets/stylesheets/icons.css.erb')
        # ... etc ...
      end
    end

Run the rake task

    bundle exec rake assets:resprite

Generates

 * sprite images in `app/assets/images`
 * sprite styles in `app/assets/stylesheets` - automatically picked up by the asset pipeline and included in your generated application.css

Extending the Library
=====================

The sprite factory library can be extended in a number of other ways.

 * provide a custom layout algorithm in the `SpriteFactory::Layout` module.
 * provide a custom style generator in the `SpriteFactory::Style` module.
 * provide a custom image library in the `SpriteFactory::Library` module.
